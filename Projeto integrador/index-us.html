                <h3>What is racism?</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="texto_1">
                <p>Racial prejudice is any and all form of expression that discriminates an ethnicity or culture by making it inferior or less capable.</p>
                <p>Also designated as racism, it’s been present in our society for many many years, not just Brazil but in the whole world.</p>
                <p>It’s important to refer that the concept of race is a social construct used to define what is really an ethnicity, the so called human races aren’t real as biological entities.</p>
                <p>It’s not news when for example, white people who practice or habit that has its roots in African culture being ostracized or judged as being in the wrong for doing what, according to racists “aren’t meant to white people”.</p>
                <p>It’s called non intentional prejudice, when there is no intention of discrimination, there is an idea of racial stereotype.</p>

                <h3>Racism in Brazil</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="texto_2">
                <p>The history of racism in Brazil has it’s beginning with the Portuguese colonization, the first to suffer prejudice due to their ethnicity were the natives who were living in the Brazilian lands when the Portuguese ships arrived.</p>
                <p>These natives, also used as slave labor, were considered inferior and even incapable of executing manual labor, for example, working in the coffee fields and the sugar cane processing plants, it was in the 15th century that the Portuguese decided to import African slave labor, as they were considered stronger physically speaking, this marks the start of the slave trafficking.</p>
                <p>When they arrived in Brazil, the African slaves were sold and became property of the Portuguese landlords, this marks the start of a societal divide between whites and blacks.</p>

                <h3>Institutionalized Racism</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="texto_3">
                <p>The concept was created to specify how racism manifests in the structure of organized society and its institutions, in a general manner, it’s defined as the privilege given to a certain group of individuals in detriment of other groups. Reveling itself in the difference of treatment, service distribution and general welfare.</p>
                <p>In Brazil, it’s possible to identify institutionalized racism in all types of institutions, both public held and private, the concept of institutionalized racism is manly common within interpersonal situations, that is when someone is being discriminated and they report on it, the tendency, especially among the upper management is to classify this as an issue with the victim, this is because institutionalized racism makes the institution responsible for the discriminatory action against the victim, because it’s up to the institution itself to assume the role of arbiter when it comes to such acts, effectively creating “house rules” to deal with the issue, both internally and publicly relationship wise.</p>

                    <p>Data taken from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatísticas (IBGE) and Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (Ipea), from 2013 to 2015 shows that even in the 21th century, racism still grips the country among all walks of life and social strata.</p>

                    <p>Healthcare is one of the fields where most of the hard data on how racism is used as a barring mechanism when it comes to being checked into a hospital, according to the numbers from Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde released in 2013, of the people who felt being discriminated by hospital staff, 11,6% are female and 11,9% are Black, it’s worth saying that by IBGE’s standards, the black population is compost by both “mixed” and “blacks”.</p>
                    <p>The biggest number of maternal mortality (death when pregnant, childbirth and post childbirth) is among black women, with causes that are classified as safe by the health ministry, so why do they die then? They die because they aren’t well treated, from shorter checkups compared to white women, to less exams being asked, anesthesia procedures that aren’t needed or don’t even exist (due to a racist misconception that black women are more resistant to pain) legitimize racism in the health care side of our society.</p>
                    <p>The study also analyzed the perceived motives by the people who felt discriminated against it in health care, and over half of the population 18 and older felt discriminated due to their ethnicity.</p>

                    <p>In the education part, the number of people of color in college grade increased and almost doubled between 2005 to 2015, according to data from IBGE, in 2005 just a year after the affirmatives actions were implanted. Like quotas, only 5.5% of black and mixed young men and women in college age were in university. 10 years later 12,85 of blacks between 18 to 24 managed to get into college, in middle school for example, whites get to study for 6.7 years in average, while blacks stop at 4 years and a half, which is equivalent to the first cycle of learning, due to the amount of hurdles and blockades people of color have to go thought compared to white people.</p>
                    <p>This difference shows that even with affirmative actions and raising awareness, people of color are still the minority in colleges and universities.</p>

                        <p>My name is Paloma Castro, I’m 16 years’ old and I’ve been victim of racism, due to my ethnicity, hair, gender and sexuality, before due to lack of maturity I would get angry, isolate myself and cry, got to the point of self-mutilations due to racism, today I seek out my rights to defend myself against such behavior, but I still get hurt when I’m a victim of racism, for example not even getting a job due to the fact the interviewer was racist, but I will not lower my head due to it.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the abuse I suffered was inside the school, but now that I know how to deal with it, I wouldn’t bite into it, I would have a reaction of course at the moment of the act, would be polite to the aggressor, to show that while I’m a black woman with afro hair, I’m also a human being, and I bear no ill intent towards anyone, even the aggressor, not even the world.</p>

                    <p>One piece of advice I can give is: before judging someone, try to know about them, know their story, walk a mile in their shoes, don’t judge based off skin color, financial standing, sexuality or looks, people are more than social status, sometimes what little people have, is more than enough to tell who they truly are</p>

                    <p>12 years ago, I was a soccer player, I had just finished signing up a contract with the Internacional de Porto Alegre soccer club, in Rio Grande do Sul, the prejudice I suffer wasn’t the physical or verbal kind, but via their actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the first night when I went to get supper in the mess hall together with the other boys, I had just grabbed my plate and thought to myself that this would be a golden opportunity to make new friends while eating with them, in the table there were 8 boys, when I got close to sit, I said good afternoon to everyone, but nobody answered me back, I thought that they didn’t hear me at first, but I’m sure they did. The moment I lowered my head to eat, they all got up and walked away, leaving me alone in the table, at that moment I had no reaction, I was feeling overwhelmed with shame, didn’t do nothing but finishing eating my plate with my head lowered to get out of there as fast as possible, in the next day I spoke with the social worker that I didn’t want to stay there anymore. She didn’t understand the motive given I didn’t tell her about the incident, I don’t know if that was the right thing to do, but I didn’t know how to act, there was no reason for them to have act the way they did with me like that, the little time I spent there, I was just doing medical exams, I had no prior contact with anyone on the team.</p>
                    <p>If I had the opportunity to speak with those people, I would only ask if it was worth it, leaving me alone on that day, and if any of them suffered from guilty conscience for doing such an act against me.</p>
